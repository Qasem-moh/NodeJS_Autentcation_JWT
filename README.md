JWT stands for JSON Web Token, and it's a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. JWTs are commonly used for authentication and authorization in web applications, where they are used to securely transmit information between the client (such as a web browser) and the server.

Here's an overview of how JWT works and its components:

1. **Structure:** JWTs consist of three parts separated by dots: the header, the payload, and the signature. For example: `xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz`

2. **Header:** The header typically consists of two parts: the type of token (which is JWT) and the signing algorithm being used, such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA. It is base64url encoded.

3. **Payload:** The payload contains the claims, which are statements about the entity (typically the user) and additional data. There are three types of claims: registered, public, and private claims. It is also base64url encoded.

4. **Signature:** The signature is used to verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is and to ensure that the message wasn't changed along the way. It's created by combining the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret key, and the algorithm specified in the header.

When a user logs in to a web application, the server generates a JWT and sends it back to the client. The client then includes the JWT in subsequent requests, typically in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token. The server verifies the JWT to ensure its authenticity and validity. If the JWT is valid, the server grants access to the requested resources or operations.

JWTs offer several benefits:

- **Statelessness:** Since JWTs contain all necessary information, servers don't need to store session data, making them stateless and scalable.
- **Security:** JWTs can be digitally signed and encrypted to ensure their integrity and confidentiality.
- **Interoperability:** JWTs are widely supported across different platforms, languages, and frameworks.

However, it's important to handle JWTs securely:

- **Keep Secrets Secure:** When using HMAC-based algorithms, ensure that the secret key used for signing JWTs is kept secure.
- **Expiration:** Set reasonable expiration times for JWTs to mitigate the risk of replay attacks.
- **Validation:** Always validate incoming JWTs to ensure their authenticity, integrity, and validity.
